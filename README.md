# Memory demo

These examples are a simplified version of the [previously posted problem](https://github.com/milovanovic/chipyard/tree/1.9.0_queue) expanded for multiple memory classes. Scala code for this example can be found [here](./src/main/scala/example/MemExample.scala).

The main problem is that the transformation of `SInt`-based memories cannot be performed.

For `UInt`-based *Queue*, *Mem* or *SyncReadMem*, Verilog code will be succesfully generated but for `SInt`-based memories Verilog generation fails with the following error:
```scala
Decoupled.scala:274:95: error: memories should be flattened before running LowerMemory
Decoupled.scala:274:95: note: see current operation: %5:2 = "firrtl.mem"() {annotations = [], depth = 1024 : i64, name = "ram", nameKind = #firrtl<name_kind droppable_name>, portAnnotations = [[], []], portNames = ["MPORT", "io_deq_bits_MPORT"], readLatency = 0 : i32, ruw = 0 : i32, writeLatency = 1 : i32} : () -> (!firrtl.bundle<addr: uint<10>, en: uint<1>, clk: clock, data: sint<16>, mask: uint<1>>, !firrtl.bundle<addr: uint<10>, en: uint<1>, clk: clock, data flip: sint<16>>)
```

To reproduce this error, please run:
```bash
make sintQueue # for SInt-based Queue. Error expected
# or
make sintSyncMem # for SInt-based SyncReadMem. Error expected
# or
make sintMem # for SInt-based Mem. Error expected
```
or to generate Verilog successfully run:
```bash
make uintQueue # for UInt-based Queue. Should be successful
# or
make uintSyncMem # for UInt-based SyncReadMem. Should be successful
# or
make uintMem # for UInt-based Mem. Should be successful
```

The Makefile flow used in this example is based on Chipyard's [common.mk](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/main/common.mk).

Firtool release [1.37.0](https://github.com/llvm/circt/releases/tag/firtool-1.37.0) was used.
